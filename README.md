<h1> Hey <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1577305505/7373/hand_wave.gif?1577305505" width="50" /> What's up?</h1>

Hi, I’m **Audrey** — a software engineer turned founder turned MBA student, building SaaS products with a sharp product sense and just enough caffeine.

- 🧠 CS + Business grad from **University of Waterloo**
- 💻 Ex-Software Engineer @ Wish, TD Bank, Versaterm (Canadian based public safety software company)
- 🏢 Founded a real estate company managing $170M in commercial assets
- 🛠️ Built **VeraRent**, an AI-powered property management SaaS originally developed to streamline my own company’s operations, reducing manual work, lowering headcount, and scaling smarter. Later expanded with a RAG-powered chatbot and other AI features, and now working on commercialization.
- 🤝 Also the founding product manager at **Netup**, a mentorship platform that connects international students with mentors working at big tech companies, helping more people break into tech
- 🎯 Currently doing my MBA at UCLA Anderson and I wish to continue to build better product post MBA

> I like my UX clean, my MVPs lean, and my onboarding flows shorter than a TikTok.
> I believe great products are built at the intersection of logic, empathy, and bias-for-action — sometimes with a little help from LLMs.

## 🛠 Current Project

### 🔧 VeraRent(not open-sourced): an AI-powered property management SaaS

- **What**: Automated lease tracking, rent collection, reconciliations, and financial reporting with AI-powered features like lease autofill and a RAG-based chatbot for natural language queries
- **Why**: To reduce errors, cut manual work, and help property managers operate leaner while scaling smarter
- **How**: Built end-to-end using React, Node.js, MongoDB, Amazon Textract, OpenAI API, Twilio SMS, and no-code tools for rapid prototyping

> It’s like Asana + Airtable + ChatGPT had a baby that understands late rent.
