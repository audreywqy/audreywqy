## üõ† Projects

### üîß Vera Rent ‚Äì AI-powered property management SaaS

## ü§π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Fun Facts

- I ran a leasing portfolio *and* wrote my own accounting automation in the same week.
- I taught myself Vite because CRA made me cry.
- My most-used keyboard shortcut is `‚åò + Z`, followed closely by `‚åò + /`.
- My best ideas come at 11:59 PM when I swore I was going to sleep at 10.
