<h1> Hey <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1577305505/7373/hand_wave.gif?1577305505" width="50" /> What's up?</h1>

Hi, I’m **Audrey** — a software engineer turned founder turned soon-to-be MBA, building SaaS products with a sharp product sense and just enough caffeine.

- 🧠 CS + Business grad from **University of Waterloo**
- 💻 Ex-Software Engineer at Wish (Android + backend)
- 🏢 Founded a real estate company managing $170M in commercial assets
- 🛠️ Built **VeraRent**, an AI-powered property management SaaS that helped me **hire fewer people**, automate operations, and scale smarter
- 🤝 Also the founding product manager at **Netup**, a mentorship platform that connects international students with mentors working at big tech companies — helping more people break into tech
- 🎯 Transitioning into **product management**, blending engineering intuition with operator grit

> I like my UX clean, my MVPs lean, and my onboarding flows shorter than a TikTok.
> I believe great products are built at the intersection of logic, empathy, and bias-for-action — sometimes with a little help from LLMs.
